    "description": "The perfect gift for any dog lover, this is the story of man's best friend from the canine gods of Ancient Egypt to the heroic mascots of the Second World War. Over the millennia dogs have been hailed as gods, demons, saints, military heroes, even reigning kings – and all the while have been the keen hunters, loyal guards and beloved pets we know today. They feature in Egyptian myth, classical astronomy, medieval romances and early modern portraiture; they took part in the court-life of Imperial China, in early Hollywood film studios and in intrepid expeditions to the North Pole. Featuring the pampered pets of Queen Victoria and Pablo Picasso, popular medieval dog names, regimental mascots of the Napoleonic Wars and tales of canine loyalty through the ages, this beautifully illustrated volume shows how dogs have for millennia been the beloved companions of peasants and princes alike.",

    "description": "That the dog evolved from the wolf is an accepted fact of evolution, but the question of how wolf became dog has remained a mystery, obscured by myth and legend. How the Dog Became the Dog presents the 'domestication' of the dog as a biological and cultural process that began with cooperation and has taken a number of radical turns since. At the end of the last Ice Age, the first dogs emerged with their humans from refuge against the cold. In the eighteenth century, humans began the drive to exercise full control of dog reproduction, life and death, to complete the domestication of the wolf that began so long ago.",

    "description": "WINNER OF THE 2017 VICTORIAN PREMIER'S LITERARY AWARD FOR FICTION WINNER OF THE 2016 UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND FICTION BOOK AWARD SHORTLISTED FOR THE 2017 STELLA PRIZE Outside, the rain continues unceasing; silver sheets sluicing down, the trees and shrubs soaking and bedraggled, the earth sodden, puddles overflowing, torrents coursing onwards, as the darkness slowly softens with the dawn. Ester is a family therapist with an appointment book that catalogues the anxieties of the middle class: loneliness, relationships, death. She spends her days helping others find happiness, but her own family relationships are tense and frayed. Estranged from both her sister, April, and her ex-husband, Lawrence, Ester wants to fall in love again. Meanwhile, April is struggling through her own directionless life; Lawrence’s reckless past decisions are catching up with him; and Ester and April's mother, Hilary, is about to make a choice that will profoundly affect them all. Taking place largely over one rainy day in Sydney, and rendered with the evocative and powerful prose Blain is known for, Between a Wolf and a Dog is a celebration of the best in all of us — our capacity to live in the face of ordinary sorrows, and to draw strength from the transformative power of art. Ultimately, it is a joyous tribute to the beauty of being alive. PRAISE FOR GEORGIA BLAIN ‘[An] elegant, intelligent and affecting novel from a writer at the height of her powers.’ The Saturday Paper ‘Like all her novels, Between a Wolf and a Dog explores the often unarticulated complexities of the intersection of the personal and the political with exquisite grace and intelligence.’ Australian Book Review",
